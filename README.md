## introduction
This is a script that enables batch downloading of protein sequences encoded by index terms from the NCBI website.
At my Professor's request, I needed to search for or download all protein-coding data associated with specific keywords on the NCBI website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). To automate this process and free up my hands, I employed automation technology (Selenium) to perform the downloads.
